/*
Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in xx units of time, he finishes it in m * xmâˆ—x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max dd units of time. Given x, m, dx,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.
