/*
A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.

The Little Elephant has K favorite lucky strings A1, A2, ..., AK. He thinks that the lucky string S is good if either |S| â‰¥ 47 or for some j from 1 to K we have that Aj is a substring of S.

The Little Elephant has found N lucky strings B1, B2, ..., BN under the pillow. Now he wants to know which of them are good. Help him and find for each i from 1 to N whether the string Bi is good or not.
