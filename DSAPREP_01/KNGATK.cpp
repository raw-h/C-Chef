/*
Nightking wants to attack the kingdom and he really likes cold days. However, he doesnâ€™t want to attack the kingdom on the coldest day, because it is obvious.
Instead, he will attack the second coldest day. Given an array A of N distinct integers where A[i] represents the temperature forecast of the i-th day, You need to find the temperature of the day of the attack.
